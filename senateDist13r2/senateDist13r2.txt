  Description:
    Abstract: Rhode Island General Assembly Senate Districts implemented for the 2012 election cycle.  This dataset is a modified version of the source data that are produced and distributed by the U.S. Census Bureau.  It has been clipped to the Rhode Island coastline for cartographic purposes, and reprojected to the Rhode Island State Plane (foot) coordinate system for ease of use.
    Purpose: In order for others to use the information in the Census MAF/TIGER database in a geographic information system (GIS) or for other geographic applications, the Census Bureau releases to the public extracts of the database in the form of TIGER/Line Shapefiles.
    Supplemental_Information: The TIGER/Line shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. State Legislative Districts (SLDs) are the areas from which members are elected to State legislatures. The SLDs embody the upper (senate) and lower (house) chambers of the State legislature. Nebraska has a unicameral legislature and the District of Columbia has a single council, both of which the Census Bureau treats as upper-chamber legislative areas for the purpose of data presentation; there are no data by SLDL for either Nebraska or the District of Columbia. A unique three-character census code, identified by State participants, is assigned to each SLD within a State. In Connecticut, Illinois, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Ohio, and Puerto Rico, the Redistricting Data Program (RDP) participant did not define the SLDs to cover all of the State or State equivalent area. In these areas with no SLDs defined, the code "ZZZ" has been assigned, which is treated as a single SLD for purposes of data presentation. The boundaries of the 2012 State legislative districts were provided by State-level participants through the Redistricting Data Program (RDP) and reflect the districts used to elect members in or prior to the November 2012 election.

Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report: Accurate against Federal Information Processing Series (FIPS), FIPS Publication 6-4, and FIPS-55 at the 100% level for the codes and base names. The remaining attribute information has been examined but has not been fully tested for accuracy.
  Logical_Consistency_Report: The Census Bureau performed automated tests to ensure logical consistency and limits of shapefiles. Segments making up the outer and inner boundaries of a polygon tie end-to-end to completely enclose the area. All polygons are tested for closure. The Census Bureau uses its internally developed geographic update system to enhance and modify spatial and attribute data in the Census MAF/TIGER database. Standard geographic codes, such as FIPS codes for states, counties, municipalities, county subdivisions, places, American Indian/Alaska Native/Native Hawaiian areas, and congressional districts are used when encoding spatial entities. The Census Bureau performed spatial data tests for logical consistency of the codes during the compilation of the original Census MAF/TIGER database files. Most of the codes for geographic entities except states, counties, urban areas, Core Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs), American Indian Areas (AIAs), and congressional districts were provided to the Census Bureau by the USGS, the agency responsible for maintaining FIPS 55. Feature attribute information has been examined but has not been fully tested for consistency. For the TIGER/Line Shapefiles, the Point and Vector Object Count for the G-polygon SDTS Point and Vector Object Type reflects the number of records in the shapefile attribute table. For multi-polygon features, only one attribute record exists for each multi-polygon rather than one attribute record per individual G-polygon component of the multi-polygon feature. TIGER/Line Shapefile multi-polygons are an exception to the G-polygon object type classification. Therefore, when multi-polygons exist in a shapefile, the object count will be less than the actual number of G-polygons.
  Completeness_Report: Data completeness of the TIGER/Line Shapefiles reflects the contents of the Census MAF/TIGER database at the time the TIGER/Line Shapefiles were created.

      Process_Description: TIGER/Line Shapefiles are extracted from the Census MAF/TIGER database by nation, state, county, and entity. Census MAF/TIGER data for all of the aforementioned geographic entities are then distributed among the shapefiles each containing attributes for line, polygon, or landmark geographic data.
      Source_Used_Citation_Abbreviation: MAF/TIGER
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: Source TIGER/Line shapefile for the State of Rhode Island downloaded from the U.S. Census Bureau via http://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGERrd13_st/44.  Data reprojected to the NAD 83 Rhode Island state plane (foot) coordinate system.  "State, Coastline, Town Boundaries" dataset acquired from RIGIS, dissolved to create a single multipart dataset that represents the inland state boundary and coastline.  Reprojected TIGER/Line shapefiles clipped using this state boundary dataset, improving it for cartographic purposes.  Deleted ancillary attribute fields before contributing this dataset to RIGIS.
